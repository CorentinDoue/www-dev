    I am a french engineering student at the <a href="https://www.mines-stetienne.fr/">Ã‰cole des Mines de Saint-Etienne</a>.
    I majored in Computer Sciences and Artificial Intelligence during the past year.
    For my last year before graduation, I am going to major in Data Sciences and Big Data.

    Together with my courses, I am most of the time building web development projects. To achieve them, I use a lot of MOOCs and read many articles.
    That is how I acquired plenty of skills. <a class="more" routerLink="/skills">Learn more ...</a>

    The engineering school makes me also discover the student's associations.
    I spend the last year in three Executive Committee of associations including the Student Union of the school.
    It learns me a lot about team management and commitment.

    Moreover I find time for my hobbies. I run at least ones a week. I am also regularly practising climbing and skiing. I enjoy cooking and crafting too.
